\section{Experience}

\cventry{November~2022 -- Now}{Machine learning engineer}{Stability.ai}{Amsterdam}{}{
  I worked on the following projects:
\begin{itemize}   
    \item Stable-Finetuning (Python, PyTorch, CUDA, diffusion models, HPC):
    I was mostly focused on whole preprocessing and training algorithm optimization.
    With my effort, the fine-tuning prosess became multiple times faster while the size of model increased.
    I managed to "accelerate" SAM to process big batches of images in less than 1 second.
    To comply with regulation, I managed to build a facial fine-tuning without facial keypoints detection.
    During the developed process, I was migrating the service between multiple generations of fine-tuned models and backends.
    \item Stability models API (Python, PyTorch, CUDA, diffusion models, AWS, HPC):
    Similar effort but without direct involvement into algorithms development.
    \item LLM-related project (Python, PyTorch, CUDA, LLMs, axolotl, HPC).
\end{itemize}}
